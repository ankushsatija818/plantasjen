## Colour Usage

<a name="colourUsage"></a>

We have a new palette of colours. Inspired by all things in nature - soil, leaves, and conifers.

The colours for Plantagen are available in Pantone, CMYK, RGB, NCS.

`Shell` is our lightest colour and is only to be used in illustrations and graphics as a compliment to `Primary Beige`. `Do not use as solid background.`

`Terracotta` is our call-to-action colour and is only to be used when we want to bring extra attention to our new products.

Please note: The primary choice of colours for the logotype should always be Pantone. It reduces the risk of things going wrong in the printing process and secures the colour of the logotype and a successful end result. The Pantone colour to be used is Pantone `3546 C`.
